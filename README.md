The main focus of this project is to identify trends and significant times in weather worldwide. Data sourced by weather monitors across the globe between 1750 and 2015 will be analyzed via the C programming language and GNUPlots. This project will increase our understanding of the change of weather over timeâ€¦. The C program will apply calculations to find the average temperature within different time frames(Ex. centuries, decades, monthly). Furthermore, calculations will be displayed via GNUPlot to create graphs that will visually support the data and draw meaningful conclusions.
